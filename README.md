# The Pizza Project

Welcome to The Pizza Project. Our aim is to provide the local and surrounding communities of Bristol with the most fresh and highest quality pizza imaginable, outside of Italy or the pizza hotspots of the USA. We craft our pizza sauce and dough every morning, then load up our mobile pizza truck and head out on the open road where we top and cook our pizzas to order on site. Wether that is at your front door, wedding venue, high street or charity event. If we can drive there, we can cook there. Our pizzas are cooked in the wood fired pizza oven in the back of our pizza truck to ensure of that authentic pizza experience.

## Credit

Inspiration for The Pizza Project can be attributed to I Scream Tacos. <https://i-scream-tacos.co.uk/> A local mobile food truck based nearby where I live in Bristol, UK. That can be hired to attend local or private events and serve their fresh daily made, traditional Mexican soft shell tacos.

Their business model was used for my project due to it's uniqueness as a method of serving and delivering quality Mexican food to Bristol and surrounding communities via a second hand repurposed ice cream van. Instead of either a operating out of a bricks and mortar establishment or more common static food trailer, likely to be found outside of sporting grounds or in a fixed location within cities or roadsides, by operating out of their taco van they have greater mobility and range than traditional outdoor food vendors which allows them to reach a wider and volumetric greater audience.
