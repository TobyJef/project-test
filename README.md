## Credit

Inspiration for The Pizza Project can be attributed to I Scream Tacos. <https://i-scream-tacos.co.uk/> A local mobile food truck near where I live in Bristol, UK. That can be hired to attend local or private events and serve their fresh daily made, traditional Mexican soft shell tacos.

Their business model was used for my project due to it's uniqueness as a method of serving and delivering quality Mexican food to Bristol and surrounding communities via a second hand repurposed ice cream van. Instead of either a operating out of a bricks and mortar establishment or more common static food trailer, likely to be found outside of sporting grounds or in a fixed location within cities or roadsides. By operating out of their former ice cream van they have greater mobility and range than traditional outdoor food vendors.
